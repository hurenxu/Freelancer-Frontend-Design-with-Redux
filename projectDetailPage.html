            Google's software engineers develop the next-generation
            technologies that change how billions of users connect, explore,
            and interact with information and one another.
            Our products need to handle information at massive scale,
            and extend well beyond web search.
            We're looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas,
            including information retrieval, distributed computing,
            large-scale system design, networking and data storage, security,
            artificial intelligence, natural language processing,
            UI design and mobile; the list goes on and is growing every day.
            As a software engineer, you will work on a specific project
            critical to Googleâ€™s needs with opportunities to switch teams
            and projects as you and our fast-paced business grow and evolve.
            We need our engineers to be versatile,
            display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic to take on
            new problems across the full-stack as we continue to push
            technology forward.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Google aspires to be an organization that reflects the globally
            diverse audience that our products and technology serve.
            We believe that in addition to hiring the best talent,
            a diversity of perspectives, ideas and cultures leads to the
            creation of better products and services.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Google is and always will be an engineering company.
            We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are
            ready to take on some of technology's greatest challenges
            and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users.
            At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search,
            they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions,
            large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers
            around the world. From AdWords to Chrome, Android to YouTube,
            Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one
            technological achievement after another.
